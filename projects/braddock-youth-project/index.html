	<h2>Braddock Youth Project</h2>
	<p class="tags">graphic design, screen printing</p>

	<p>The Braddock Youth Project is a youth work skills training program that seeks to foster skills that will aid youth in advancing toward positive life outcomes, by providing meaningful and sustainable community development projects, generated and maintained by the youth.</p> 

	<p>During the school year there are three different teams: Gardening, Mentoring, and Media. In the summer, they also have Ceramics, Community Gatherings, and Book Distribution teams.</p>

	<p>Through AmeriCorps, I served as the Media Team Coordinator at BYP and was responsible for coming up with media-related projects, mentoring youth, graphic design, and managing their Instagram and Facebook accounts.</p>

	<p>With my guidance, the youth learned or improved their skills in Photoshop, Illustrator, WordPress, photography, videography, and iMovie. They used these skills to create flyers, posters, t-shirts, Snapchat Geofilters, portraits, coloring books, wallpaper, and even a music video.</p>

	<h3>Collard Greens Cook-Off Flyer</h3>

	<p>I designed a flyer for the annual Collard Greens Cook-Off using Adobe Illustrator and the Media Team youth helped me screen print the posters for the event.</p>

	<h3>2018 Showcase Flyer</h3>

	<p>At the end of the school year, the youth present all of the projects that they've done throughout the year at the Carnegie Library of Braddock. This was the flyer I designed for the event, which the Mentoring Team helped me screen print.</p>
