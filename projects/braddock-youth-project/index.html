	<h2>Braddock Youth Project</h2>
	<p class="lighttext">graphic design, web design</p>

	<p>Braddock Youth Project is a program that hires youths aged 14-18 and teaches them workplace readiness skills. During the school year there are three different teams: Gardening, Mentoring, and Media. In the summer, they also have Ceramics, Community Gatherings, and Book Distribution teams.</p>

	<p>I served as the Media Team Coordinator and was responsible for coming up with media-related projects, mentoring youth, graphic design, and managing their Instagram and Facebook accounts.</p>

	<p>With my guidance, the youth learned or improved their skills in Photoshop, Illustrator, WordPress, photography, videography, and iMovie. They used these skills to create flyers, posters, t-shirts, Snapchat Geofilters, portraits, coloring books, wallpaper, and even a music video.</p>
