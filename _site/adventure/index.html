				<h4>May 16, 2017</h4>

				<p>Last month, I spent a week camping and climbing at Red Rock Canyon National Conservation in Nevada and it was… amazing! This was my first time out in the desert and had only climbed on the East coast (New River Gorge and Rumney) beforehand. The weather was a quite unpredictable (I thought the desert was supposed to be hot?). On the second day of our trip, right as we were preparing to start the 3rd pitch of ‘Cat in the Hat’, it began to rain and got pretty windy. We ended up having to bail and I experienced what it was like to rappel in less than ideal conditions. According to the weather advisory, the wind gusts were as strong as 60 mph. I ended up spending a sleepless night in a tent without the frame and lined the inside with rocks in order to not be blown away. That in itself was quite an adventure.</p>

				<h4>April 17, 2017</h4>

				<p>I have tried to write about web design and development a few times in the past, but had struggled to come up with original content. So, instead, I decided to start writing about another passion of mine: <strong>adventuring</strong>. Doesn’t that word kind of sound made up when said out loud?</p>
