				<p>Imagine Careers wants to change the way that people search for jobs. They're doing so with a discovery platform that lets you find companies that fit you based on factors that matter to you. Whether that's retirement benefits, work flexibility, or dress code.</p>

				<p>I was brought in to help visualize their ideas for the platform, as well as to redesign the company website.</p>
				<p>Redesign coming soon! In the meantime, feel free to check out the <a href="https://discover.imaginecareers.com/">platform</a>.</p>
