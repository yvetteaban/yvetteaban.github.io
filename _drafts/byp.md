Last year, I decided to join the AmeriCorps and had a chance to serve at a site called the Braddock Youth Project. It's a program that has hires youth and teaches them workplace skills and so much more. During the school year, they offer three different teams: Gardening, Mentoring, and Media. In the Summer, they also offer a Ceramics and Book Distribution team.

While I was there, I served as a Media Team Coordinator. Along with mentoring youth, I was responsible for coming up with media-related projects, designing flyers, and managing their social media accounts (Instagram & Facebook).
