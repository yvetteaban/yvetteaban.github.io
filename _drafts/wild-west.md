For this year's week-long climbing trip, I got to go to three different places: Lone Pine, Joshua Tree, and Red Rocks. Each area was very different from each other, but equally amazing in their own right. I think I could get used to this kind of desert life. Here are some pics from my trip to California and Nevada that are a few months overdue.
