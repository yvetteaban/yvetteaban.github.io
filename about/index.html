	<h2>Designer.</h2>

	<p>One of the things I’m passionate about is design. I'm a ux designer and researcher based out of Pittsburgh. I have years of experience designing and developing responsive websites, ranging from simple WordPress sites to custom Angular builds and designing interfaces. I've also helped clients develop their online marketing strategies and created content for social media.</p>

	</ul>    

	<h2>Adventurer.</h2>

	<p>My other passions are traveling, photography, and being outdoors. I love being outside! When I’m not designing, I can be found climbing, biking, hiking, or simply wandering around town looking for some tasty foods.</p>
