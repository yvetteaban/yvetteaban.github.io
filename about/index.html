	<h2>Designer.</h2>

	<p>One of the things I’m passionate about is design. I'm a web and ui designer based out of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BH9f5b_juY_/?taken-by=yvetteaban">Pittsburgh</a>. I have years of experience designing and developing responsive websites, ranging from simple WordPress sites to custom Angular builds and designing interfaces. Lately, I've also been helping clients develop their online marketing strategies and creating content for social media.</p>

	<p>I'm available for select freelance work - <a href="/contact/">send me a message</a>. Let's make something great together!</p>

	<h3>Some past projects:</h3>

	<ul class="project-list">

	</ul>    

	<h2>Adventurer.</h2>

	<p>My other passions are traveling, photography, and being outdoors. I love being outside! When I’m not designing, I can be found climbing, hiking, biking or simply wandering around town looking for some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BXVgUkOj4XM/?taken-by=yvetteaban">tasty foods</a>. I also have a newfound appreciation for the Spanish language.</p>
