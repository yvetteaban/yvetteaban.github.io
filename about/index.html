<div class="about">

	<h2>Designer.</h2>

	<p>One of the things I’m passionate about is design. I'm a web/ui designer based out of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BH9f5b_juY_/?taken-by=yvetteaban">Pittsburgh</a>. I have years of experience designing and developing responsive websites, ranging from simple WordPress sites to custom Angular builds. Lately, I've been helping clients develop their online marketing strategies and creating content for social media.</p>

	<p>I'm available for select freelance work. I can be reached at hello[at]yvetteaban.com. Let's make something great together!</p>

	<h2>Adventurer.</h2>

	<p>My other passions are photography and being outdoors. I love being outside! When I’m not designing, I can be found climbing, biking, camping or wandering around town looking for some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BXVgUkOj4XM/?taken-by=yvetteaban">tasty foods</a>.</p>
