<h2>About</h2>

<p>One of the things I’m passionate about is design. I'm a web/ui designer living in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BH9f5b_juY_/?taken-by=yvetteaban">Pittsburgh</a>. I have years of experience designing and developing responsive websites, ranging from simple WordPress sites to custom Angular builds. Lately, I've been designing user interfaces, with the occasional front end development (HTML/CSS).</p>

<p>I'm available for select freelance work. Let's make something great together!</p>

<h3>Some past projects:</h3>

</ul>    

<h2>Adventurer.</h2>

<p>My other passion is being outdoors. I love being outside! When I’m not designing, I can be found climbing, biking, camping or wandering around town looking for some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BXVgUkOj4XM/?taken-by=yvetteaban">tasty foods</a>.</p>
