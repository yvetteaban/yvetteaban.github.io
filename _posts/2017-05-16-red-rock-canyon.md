Last month, I spent a week camping and climbing at Red Rock Canyon National Conservation in Nevada and it was a-mazing! 

This was my first time out in the desert and had only climbed on the East coast (New River Gorge and Rumney) beforehand. The weather was a quite unpredictable (I thought the desert was supposed to be hot?). On the second day of our trip, right as we were preparing to start the 3rd pitch of 'Cat in the Hat', it began to rain and got pretty windy. We ended up having to bail and I experienced what it was like to rappel in less than ideal conditions. According to the weather advisory, the wind gusts were as strong as 60 mph. I ended up spending a sleepless night in a tent without the frame and lined the inside with rocks in order to not be blown away. That in itself was quite an adventure.

Luckily, the winds subsided and we were able to climb uninterrupted for the the remainder of the trip. I was even able to try out some nighttime climbing over at Red Riding Hood Wall. Climbing at night definitely makes you focus more, but at the same time I could see myself easily missing out on some good holds. Overall, the whole experience was fun and taught me something new about myself.
