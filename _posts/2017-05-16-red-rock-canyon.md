Last month, I spent a week camping and climbing at Red Rock Canyon National Conservation in Nevada and it was amazing! This was my first time out in the desert and had only experienced climbing on the East coast (New River Gorge and Rumney). The weather was a quite unpredictable (I thought the desert was supposed to be hot?). On the second day of the trip, it rained and there were wind gusts as fast as 60mph. Luckily, the winds subsided for the remainder of the trip and I was even able to try out some nighttime climbing. I'd definitely go back!
