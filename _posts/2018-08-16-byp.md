Last year, I joined the AmeriCorps and had a chance to serve at the Braddock Youth Project site in Braddock, PA. It's a program that has hires youth and teaches them workplace skills and so much more. During the school year, they offer three different teams: Gardening, Mentoring, and Media and in the summer, they also offer a Ceramics and Book Distribution team.

While there, I served as a Media Team Coordinator. Along with mentoring youth, I was responsible for coming up with media-related projects, designing flyers, and helped manage their social media accounts (Instagram & Facebook).

It was a wonderful getting to mentor and know these teens and I'm glad that I had the chance to experience it.
