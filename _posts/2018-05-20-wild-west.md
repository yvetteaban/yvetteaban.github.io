For this year's big climbing trip, I got to go to three different places: Lone Pine, Red Rocks, and Joshua Tree. Each area was very different from each other, but equally amazing in their own right. I think I could get used to this kind of desert life. Here are some pics from my trip to California and Nevada that are a few months overdue.
