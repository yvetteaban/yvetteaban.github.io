Earlier this year, a friend and I planned a trip to Ireland. We wanted to get the most out of the country and thought that the best way to do that was to rent a car and drive around the country. The big cities on our list were Dublin, Cork, Galway, and Belfast, with plenty of stops in between. 

We saw a lot of castles, sheep, and drank our fair share of Guinness (it does taste better over there). I got to drive on the left side or wrong side of the road for the first time. I'm kind of surprised they don't give you a mini driving course before they let you leave the parking lot. It was a little shocking making a couple of left hand turns at intersections and roundabouts, luckily most of the other drivers were pretty forgiving.

I think one of the highlights from our trip would have to be dressing up in cloaks and play sword-fighting at Castle Ward, where some of Game of Thrones was filmed. It was fun and silly way to spend a misty Irish afternoon.
