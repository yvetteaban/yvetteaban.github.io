Earlier this year, a friend and I planned a trip to Ireland. We wanted to get the most out of the country and thought that the best way to do that was to rent a car and drive around the country. The big cities on our list were Dublin, Cork, Galway, and Belfast, with plenty of stops in between. 

We saw a lot of castles, sheep, and drank our fair share of Guinness (it does taste better over there). I got to drive on the left side or wrong side of the road for the first time. I'm kind of surprised they don't give you a mini driving course before they let you leave the parking lot. It was a little shocking making a couple of left hand turns at intersections and roundabouts, luckily most of the other drivers were pretty forgiving.

We drove around the Ring of Kerry, but it took a wayyy longer than we had anticipated (8 hours instead of 4, hah). I think it was mostly due to me driving reeally slow around every single bend. Those country roads were super windy and narrow and for some reason the speed limit was 100km?! The views were gorgeous though, so it was definitely worth every panic-inducing turn.

I think one of the highlights from our trip would have to be dressing up in cloaks and play sword-fighting at Castle Ward, where some of Game of Thrones was filmed. It was fun and silly way to spend a misty Irish afternoon.
