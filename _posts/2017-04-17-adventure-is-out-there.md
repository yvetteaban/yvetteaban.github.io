I have tried to write about web design and development a few times in the past, but had struggled to come up with original content. So, instead, I decided to start writing about another passion of mine: **adventuring**. Doesn't that word kind of sound made up when said out loud?

Adventuring, to me, means to explore unknown territory. Whether that means going to a new state, a new country, or a new coffee shop. I think that the best way to learn, is to break out of one's comfort zone. Take a new path to work or step back and look at things from someone else's perspective. It's when we get a little lost, that we find something about ourselves.
